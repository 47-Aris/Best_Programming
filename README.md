1.What is Logging?

Logging  is the process of recording events, actions, or changes within a software application or system. It involves capturing and storing information about the sequence of events, errors, or exceptions that occur during the execution of the program. Logging is useful for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes, as it provides valuable insights into the system's behavior, performance, and security. Log messages can be generated at various levels, such as debug, info, warning, error, and critical, allowing developers to filter and focus on specific events or issues.

2.Why Logging is Important?

Logging is important in programming because it can help developers understand how an application behaves, debug issues, and track events. Logs can also be used for other tasks, such as:
-Performance monitoring
-Security auditing
-Compliance and record-keeping
-User behavior analysis
-Root cause analysis
-Continuous improvement
-Customer support 

3. Understanding Logging Levels

Logging levels in programming are labels that indicate the severity or urgency of logged events within an application. They help developers differentiate between various types of messages, such as informational, warnings, errors, and critical issues, allowing for effective monitoring and debugging. Common logging levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, each indicating the importance of the log message.

DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging purposes.
INFO: Normal functional messages.
WARNING: Situations that might cause issues.
ERROR: Errors that occurred during execution.
CRITICAL: Severe errors that require immediate attention.
